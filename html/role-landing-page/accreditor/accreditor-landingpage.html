            In this system you can open your assigned items, review the
            submitted evidence, and record your evaluation for the accreditation
            survey. Take your time to examine materials and share constructive,
            clear findings — your observations help improve programs and guide
            the accreditation process. Click "Evaluate" when you're ready to

            Quality assurance through the process of accreditation knows no
            boundaries. It is a never-ending process of improvement.
            Accreditation is a process by which an institution evaluates its
            educational activities and seeks an independent judgment to confirm
            the quality and continuous improvement of its programs.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Today, to ensure that we provide our students and stakeholders the
            best quality of service and education, PUP Taguig voluntarily
            submits five (5) programs — BSBA (Bachelor of Science in Business
            Administration: Marketing, Human Resources), BS Office
            Administration (Bachelor of Science in Office Administration), BS
            Accountancy (Bachelor of Science in Accountancy), BSIT (Bachelor of
            Science in Information Technology), and BSED (Bachelor of Secondary
            Education) — to the accreditation process in 2025. We remain
            committed to continuous improvement, transparency, and academic
            excellence as we work together to strengthen our programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are honored to be visited by seasoned accreditors and educational
            leaders who will help ensure the best educational experience for
            future generations. On behalf of the University officials, I extend
            my heartfelt gratitude for your expertise and time.
